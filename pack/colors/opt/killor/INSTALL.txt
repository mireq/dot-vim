Have a look into syntax/python/ and colors directories first.

copy syntax and colors into .vim

use killor theme in your vimrc:
  colorscheme killor                                                            

good luck.

PS. You probably like to have Dmitry Vasiliiv's python syntax in your
    .vim/syntax/python directory. You can get it from
    http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=790
